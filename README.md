## Purpose :thinking:
*My ideology behind this website is to provide a better user experience and to push the functionalities of Javascript and static websites. Furthermore, this would allow me to learn and improve my Javascript skills.*

## :heavy_check_mark: **Todo:**
- [x] Choose color theme
    > [Dracula color palette](https://draculatheme.com/contribute/)
- [ ] Website constraints and parameters
    > Single page design with all elements/content of the page replaced through Javascript
- [ ] Content
    - [ ] Website init:
        - If javascript is **not** enabled, the page should automatically redirect to Portfolio v1
        - Shows a custom loading animation.
            - While loading, the JS should obtaint the user's location to display the custom animation for the background.
            - Location obtained either through reverse searching user's IP address or simply obtaining the user's ip address.
        - Animation choices:
            1. Snow
            2. Rain
        *Reasons for not having any other weather choices is due to the fact that it is not visible with the chosen color palette*
    - [ ] Landing page:
        - "Aruksh Patel" with a quote and weather animation based on the users location.
